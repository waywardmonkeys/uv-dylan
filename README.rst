This is the start of a Dylan binding for `libuv <https://github.com/joyent/libuv>`_.

Make sure that you've done a recursive clone or that you init and update
git submodules.  If you don't have the libuv directory, you need to fix this.

This requires OpenDylan 2012.1 or later.

You can build this library with the ``Makefile`` which handles some necessary
configuration::

    make

A lot of work remains to be done here, we're just getting started!
