This is the start of a Dylan binding for `libuv <https://github.com/joyent/libuv>`_.

Make sure that you've done a recursive clone or that you init and update
git submodules.  If you don't have the libuv directory, you need to fix this.

This requires either a current build of Open Dylan from the master branch
or the forthcoming release of Open Dylan 2012.1.

You can build this library with the ``Makefile`` which handles some necessary
configuration::

    make

A lot of work remains to be done here, we're just getting started!
